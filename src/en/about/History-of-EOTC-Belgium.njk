    <h1>History of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Europe and Belgium</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Background: The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</h2>

    <p>
      The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is one of the oldest Christian churches in the world,
      officially established in the 4th century (around 330 AD) during the reign of King Ezana of Axum.
      It follows the Apostolic faith, preserving ancient Christian traditions, liturgy, language (Ge’ez), and theology.

    <h2>Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Europe</h2>

    <h3>Migration and Early Presence (1960s–1980s)</h3>

    <p>
      The presence of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Europe is closely linked to the history of Ethiopian migration.
      From the 1960s onward, Ethiopians arrived in Europe for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Education</li>
      <li>Diplomatic missions</li>
      <li>Work opportunities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A larger wave of migration occurred from the 1970s–1990s due to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Political instability</li>
      <li>The Derg regime</li>
      <li>Economic hardship</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As Ethiopian communities grew, believers felt a strong spiritual and cultural need to worship according to 
      the Orthodox faith of their ancestors.
    </p>

    <h3>Establishment of Church Communities</h3>

    <p>Initially:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Services were held in private homes, rented halls, or shared church buildings.</li>
      <li>Priests were invited from Ethiopia temporarily.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Gradually:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Permanent church communities were formed in major European cities.</li>
      <li>Priests and deacons were assigned.</li>
      <li>Diocesan structures were organized under the Holy Synod in Ethiopia.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Today, Ethiopian Orthodox churches exist across:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Germany</li>
      <li>Sweden</li>
      <li>Italy</li>
      <li>United Kingdom</li>
      <li>France</li>
      <li>Belgium</li>
      <li>The Netherlands</li>
      <li>Switzerland</li>
      <li>Many other European countries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Belgium</h2>

    <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>

    <p>
      The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Belgium began with small communities of Ethiopian believers,
      especially in Brussels, Antwerp, and nearby cities.
    </p>

    <p>These communities were formed by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ethiopian immigrants</li>
      <li>Refugees</li>
      <li>Families seeking to preserve their faith and identity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In the beginning, worship services were held occasionally—often in rented halls or other Christian churches.
    </p>

    <h3>Growth and Organization</h3>

    <p>As the community grew:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Regular Divine Liturgy (Kidase) services were established.</li>
      <li>Sunday schools and youth programs were formed.</li>
      <li>The church became a spiritual, cultural, and community center.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The church in Belgium operates under the guidance of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Holy Synod,
      maintaining full communion with the Mother Church in Ethiopia.
    </p>

    <h3>Role of the Church in Belgium</h3>

    <p>The Church provides:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Preservation of Orthodox faith and teachings</li>
      <li>Teaching of traditions and the Ge’ez/Amharic liturgical heritage</li>
      <li>Spiritual education for children and youth</li>
      <li>Pastoral care, counseling, and community support</li>
      <li>Unity and fellowship among Ethiopian believers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The church also collaborates respectfully with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Other Orthodox churches</li>
      <li>Local Christian communities</li>
      <li>Belgian institutions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Today and the Future</h2>

    <p>
      Today, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Belgium continues to grow alongside the Ethiopian community.
      Its mission remains:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>To proclaim the Gospel of Christ</li>
      <li>To preserve the Orthodox faith</li>
      <li>To serve believers spiritually and socially</li>
      <li>To pass the faith to future generations in Europe</li>
    </ul>
