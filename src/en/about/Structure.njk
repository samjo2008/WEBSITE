    <p><strong>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit One God</strong></p>

    <p>
      <strong>Ecclesiastical Constitution (Qale Awadee)</strong> of Parish Council Revised for the Fourth Time
      and Issued in 2009 E.C. to Strengthen the Unity and Administration of the Holy Church
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Whereas</strong>, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC) is required to be organized in parish council
      through the union of clergies and the faithful as per the pronouncement of proclamation No. 83/65 (first year),
      No. 1 Ecclesiastical Constitution (Qale Awadee) issued on Tikmit 15, 1965 E.C. (October 25, 1972); the revised
      Ecclesiastical Constitution (Qale Awadee) of the parish council issued on Miazia 19, 1970 E.C. (April 27, 1978);
      the revised bylaw of the parish council issued on December 10, 1974 E.C.; the revised bylaw of the parish council
      issued on Ginbot 9, 1977 E.C. (May 17, 1985); and the bylaw revised for the third time and issued in 1991 E.C. (1998),
      as well as the directives passed at different times required to be amended and combined together in one fold;
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Whereas</strong>, the Church is organized through the congregation of clergies and the faithful, and its being led by
      the parish council administration is not a new trend; rather, it is of early times on the basis of church history and
      holy scriptures, particularly the texts in Acts of the Apostles;
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Whereas</strong>, being cognizant of its leadership and administration has been as per the law and practice deliberated,
      decided, and passed through the council of apostles held at Jerusalem and considering that it has been led through the heads
      who have been spiritually nominated and elected by the congregation of clergies and followers’ general assembly
      (Acts of the Apostles 6:1–6);
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Whereas</strong>, by recognizing that the assets and property of the Church are solicited from the contribution of the faithful
      to be mobilized for accomplishment of apostolic missions and supporting the destitute (Acts of the Apostles 4:32; 5:11; 1 Cor. 16:1–11);
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Whereas</strong>, by recognizing that disagreement, if it happens with Church administration, should be seen and resolved
      through spiritual justice;
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Whereas</strong>, as provided in the Holy Scriptures (Leviticus 27:26–33; Deuteronomy 14:22; Numbers 18:20–29; Malachi 3:7–12;
      Wisdom of Sirach 7:31–32; 32:10–13; 1 Corinthians 16:1–5; Acts of the Apostles 4:32–36), it is the spiritual obligation of the clergies
      and the faithful that they pay the tithe for the temple of God and for its servants, the clergies, from every wealth and property they acquire;
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Whereas</strong>, as a whole, in order to ensure that the Church operates being led and organized by its own law and system in terms of
      administration, spiritual justice, service, and economic issues;
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Whereas</strong>, it is deemed essential to issue rules and regulations through the Holy Synod of the Church that enable the parish councils
      that are already established and yet to be established at different levels to be reinforced with their respective legal framework, as well as the
      powers and functions of the various departments be identified properly;
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>With the help of the Most High God</strong>, Who is the owner of all of the laws, and as per its spiritual authority, the EOTC’s Holy Synod
      has issued the Qale Awadi (Ecclesiastical Constitution) presented as follows:
