    <h1>Mission, Vision &amp; Values</h1>
    <h2>Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Belgium</h2>

    <hr>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
      Our mission is to glorify the Holy Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—through faithful worship,
      the celebration of the Holy Mysteries, and a life rooted in the apostolic faith of the Ethiopian
      Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
    </p>

    <p>
      We exist to proclaim the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, as received from the Holy Apostles 
      and preserved by the Holy Fathers of the Church.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are called to guard the true faith, to teach sound doctrine, and to nurture the spiritual life of the faithful
      through prayer, fasting, Holy Liturgy, and the sacraments. Our mission is to gather the faithful into one Body of Christ,
      strengthening them in repentance, humility, and love.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also seek to serve our community with mercy and compassion, supporting families, youth, elders, and those in need,
      especially those living in diaspora. Through our witness, we strive to manifest the love of Christ and the peace of God
      within Belgian society and beyond.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>

    <p>
      Our vision is to be a faithful Orthodox Christian community, shining the light of Christ through holy living
      and true worship in Belgium and Europe. We envision a church firmly rooted in the ancient faith of Ethiopia,
      while faithfully serving the spiritual needs of present and future generations.
    </p>

    <p>
      We seek to raise children and youth in the fear of God and in the knowledge of the Orthodox faith.
      We envision a united community living in repentance, humility, and mutual love, guided by the Holy Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our vision is to be a spiritual home where the faithful grow in holiness and prepare for the Kingdom of God.
      Through evangelism, catechesis, and pastoral care, we aspire to bear lasting fruit for the glory of God.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>

    <h3>1. Apostolic Faith and Holy Tradition</h3>
    <p>
      We hold fast to the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic faith, preserving the teachings of the Holy Scriptures,
      the Holy Fathers, and the sacred traditions of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
    </p>
    <blockquote>“Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught.” — 2 Thessalonians 2:15</blockquote>

    <h3>2. Holy Liturgy and Sacramental Life</h3>
    <p>
      We center our life in the Holy Liturgy, the Holy Eucharist, prayer, fasting, and the life-giving sacraments,
      through which the faithful receive grace and spiritual renewal.
    </p>
    <blockquote>“Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you.” — John 6:53</blockquote>

    <h3>3. Life of Repentance and Holiness</h3>
    <p>
      We strive to live a life of repentance, humility, and holiness, continually seeking purification of heart
      and transformation in Christ.
    </p>
    <blockquote>“Be holy, for I am holy.” — 1 Peter 1:16</blockquote>

    <h3>4. Love, Unity, and Community</h3>
    <p>
      We are called to live as one Body in Christ, bound together by love, forgiveness, and unity,
      bearing one another’s burdens.
    </p>
    <blockquote>“By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” — John 13:35</blockquote>

    <h3>5. Service, Mercy, and Witness</h3>
    <p>
      We serve Christ by serving others, showing mercy to the poor, the sick, the stranger, and the needy,
      and bearing faithful witness to the Gospel through our lives.
    </p>
