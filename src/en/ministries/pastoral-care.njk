    <h1>Pastoral Care & Spiritual Support</h1>

    <p class="scripture">
      “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.”<br>
      <span class="scripture-ref">— Matthew 11:28</span>

    <!-- WELCOME -->
    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      The clergy of our parish are here to serve the spiritual needs of our community.
      In moments of joy, sickness, sorrow, confusion, or transition, our priests are
      available to offer prayer, guidance, and the life‑giving Holy Sacraments of the Church.
    </p>

    <!-- OUR CALLING -->
    <h2>Our Calling</h2>
    <p>
      Pastoral care is a sacred responsibility. Our calling is to walk beside you through
      all of life’s seasons — celebrating new beginnings, supporting you through illness
      or hardship, comforting you in times of grief, and strengthening you in your
      spiritual journey. All pastoral conversations are held in strict confidentiality.
    </p>
