    <h2>Nurturing Faith, Building Community</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the central hub for Christian Education at St. Mary's Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
      Our Sunday School ministry is dedicated to nurturing our children, youth, and young adults in the sacred
      teachings and rich heritage of our Tewahedo faith.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is to provide a loving and engaging environment where every member can build a strong spiritual
      foundation, grow in their relationship with God, and connect with their church community.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page serves as the gateway for all our Sunday School groups. While our Children's Ministry, Young Adults
      Ministry, and St. Yared Sacred Instruments Ministry pages offer detailed information about their programs,
      this page is your action hub.
